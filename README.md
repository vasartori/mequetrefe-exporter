# mequetrefe-exporter
A exporter for [prometheus](http://prometheus.io) based on shell commands.

I don't know where I use it... if you found, let me know. :p

TODO:

- Improve the data structure to support labels, descriptions...
- Validate the YAML "config" file
- Prevent invalid data on metrics. Eg strings

and a lot of things...
